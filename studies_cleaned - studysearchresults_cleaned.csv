FMRI and EEG approaches to the resting state in ASD,"In the context of increasing prevalence the brain bases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain incompletely understood.

"Effects of poverty on affective development: A multi-level, longitudinal study","One in five children in the US grows up in poverty. These children face high risk for psychopathology, which often lasts a lifetime and perpetuates low socioeconomic status. Thus, poverty and its sequelae represent a major public health problem. Poor children often experience greater chronic stress, which may allow poverty to become biologically embedded by altering brain and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function.

Phenotypic Characterization of Gene Disrupting Mutations in ASD,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. Efforts to identifying subtypes based on the behavioral and neural phenotypes have been unsuccessful, and the rarity of specific genetic events renders subtyping at the CNV or exonic mutation level challenging and exceedingly resource-intensive.

Representation of real-world event schemas during narrative perception,"Understanding movies and stories requires maintaining a high-level situation model that abstracts away from perceptual details to describe the location, characters, actions, and causal relationships of the currently unfolding event. These models are built not only from information present in the current narrative, but also from prior knowledge about schematic event scripts, which describe typical event sequences encountered throughout a lifetime.

Negative Symptoms in Clinical High Risk and First Episode Psychiatric Illness: Investigation of a New Candidate for Targeted Treatment.,"Negative symptoms such as avolition, blunted affect, anhedonia, and social withdrawal, are debilitating, persistent, and significantly contribute to the huge personal and economic cost of severe psychiatric illnesses. In recent onset RO patients, negative symptoms are associated with poor functional outcomes. In individuals at clinical high-risk CHR for psychosis, negative symptoms can predict transition, and are also associated with poor and deteriorating functioning.

In contrast, each person has direct access to the contents of their own mind.

The social brain automatically predicts others’ future mental states,"Social life requires people to predict the future: people must anticipate others’ thoughts, feelings,and actions in order to interact with them successfully. The theory of predictive coding suggests that the social brain may meet this need by automatically predicting others’ social futures. If so, when representing others’ current mental state, the brain should already start representing their future states.

"Brain-based sex differences in autism spectrum disorder across the lifespan: A systematic review of structural MRI, fMRI, and DTI findings","Females with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been long overlooked in neuroscience research, but emerging evidence suggests they show distinct phenotypic trajectories and age-related brain differences. Sex-related biological factors (e.g., hormones, genes) may play a role in ASD etiology and have been shown to influence neurodevelopmental trajectories. Thus, a lifespan approach is warranted to understand brain-based sex differences in ASD. This systematic review on MRI-based sex differences in ... more",,,,,Paper,778,530,248,0.681233933,0.318766067,5/17/21,col_50,row_08
Vocabulary Comprehension in MV Children with ASD,The majority of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience early language delays; approximately 30% continue to be minimally verbal throughout childhood. The current study examined the syntactic and semantic features of the early words that 31 minimally verbal (MV) children with ASD were reported to understand. This receptive vocabulary profile was compared to 124 TD toddlers who were matched on expressive vocabulary and 124 TD toddlers who were matched on receptive vocabulary. Word-level ... more,,,,,Paper,31,23,8,0.741935484,0.258064516,5/20/21,col_50,row_09
What Is the Link Between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Sleep Disturbance? A Multimodal Examination of Longitudinal Relationships and Brain Structure Using Large-Scale Population-Based Cohorts,"Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbid with sleep disturbances can produce profound disruption in daily life and negatively impact quality of life of both the child and the family. However, the temporal relationship between ADHD and sleep impairment is unclear, as are underlying common brain mechanisms. Methods: This study used data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (n = 1601, 52% female) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (n ... more",,,,,Paper,3078,1610,1468,0.523066927,0.476933073,5/25/21,col_50,row_10
Efficacy of attention bias modification training for depressed adults: a randomized clinical trial.,"This study examined the efficacy of attention bias modification training (ABMT) for the treatment of depression. METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 145 adults (77% female, 62% white) with at least moderate depression severity [i.e. self-reported Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) ⩾13] and a negative attention bias were randomized to active ABMT, sham ABMT, or assessments only. The training consisted of two in-clinic and three (brief) at-home ABMT sessions.",,,,,Paper,145,33,112,0.227586207,0.772413793,5/27/21,col_50,row_11
Assessing the Psychometric Properties of the PROMIS Sleep Measures in Persons with Psychosis.,"An accumulation of research has indicated that persons with psychotic disorders experience a variety of sleep disturbances. However, few studies have examined the psychometric properties of sleep assessments that are utilized in this population. We conducted two studies to examine the reliability and validity of the PROMISTM Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-Related Impairment scales in outpatient samples of persons with psychosis. In Study 1, we examined the internal consistency and convergent validity ... more",,,,,Paper,120,74,46,0.616666667,0.383333333,5/28/21,col_50,row_12
? Study Title: Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study® (ABCD) Data Release: COVID Rapid Response Research (RRR) Survey Second data release,"The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development℠ Study (ABCD Study®), the largest longitudinal study of brain development and child health in the United States, follows over 10 years 11,878 children recruited from 21 U.S. research sites, recruited at ages 9-10 in 2016-18. In March 2020, when our participants were ages 11- to 13-years-old, the world became substantially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to an upheaval in the economy and the lives of almost every family.

"Shared genetic etiology between cortical brain morphology and tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis use","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genomic variants associated with brain morphology and substance use behaviors (SUB). However, the genetic overlap between brain structure and SUB has not been characterized. We leveraged GWAS summary data of 71 brain imaging measures and alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use to investigate their genetic overlap using a linkage disequilibrium score regression. We used genomic structural equation modeling to model a ‘SUB common genetic factor’ and ... more",,,,,Paper,10403,5492,4911,0.527924637,0.472075363,6/20/21,col_50,row_15
Breastfeeding Duration is Associated With Domain-Specific Improvements in Cognitive Performance in 9-10-Year-Old Children,"Significant immunological, physical and neurological benefits of breastfeeding in infancy are well-established, but to what extent these gains persist into later childhood remain uncertain. This study examines the association between breastfeeding duration and subsequent domain-specific cognitive performance in a diverse sample of 9-10-year-olds enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study®. The analyses included 9,116 children that attended baseline with their biological mother ... more",,,,,Paper,9139,4721,4418,0.516577306,0.483422694,6/23/21,col_50,row_16
Resting-state fMRI effective connectivity of deep grey motor networks in children with developmental movement disorders,"INTRODUCTION/HYPOTHESIS/SCIENTIFIC PREMISE Developmental movement disorders, such as dystonic cerebral palsy (CP-D), can dramatically influence quality of life and functioning and are often refractory to treatment. Pediatric movement disorders are increasingly conceptualized as brain network disorders- particularly dysfunction involving basal ganglia networks – which may be targeted for treatment. However, little is known about the nature of cortical and subcortical motor network disturbances involved, ... more",,,,,Paper,19,11,8,0.578947368,0.421052632,8/4/21,col_50,row_17
